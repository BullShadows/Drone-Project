DISCLAIMER – PLEASE READ

This project was created as a personal hobby and learning experience, not as a professional or commercial drone build.

The included file "DroneLab.docx" is a sarcastic 'lab report' written for fun.  
It details the process of building the drone, including all the mistakes, failures, and unexpected problems — often in a humorous way.

Nothing in the lab report should be taken as formal engineering documentation or best practices.  
The code and design choices reflect experimentation and learning, not production-ready engineering and in no way should be perceived as good code.

If you’re here to learn or replicate the project:
- You are welcome to use the code and ideas, but understand that it’s a hobbyist-level project.
- No guarantees are made regarding safety, reliability, or compliance with any regulations.
- Fly safe and follow all local drone laws.
- Make sure you have a good frame otherwise the drone will not fly.

Enjoy the build and have fun — that’s what this project was about.


Other:

Safety was taken into consideration for all testing and I have a hobbyist drone flying permit please make sure you do the same if testing or flying any drone. (TRUST test)
